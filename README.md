# face-detection
This is a face detection project that uses machine learning techniques to detect faces in images. It utilizes OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model to achieve accurate face detection.

# Features
Detects faces in images with high accuracy.

Supports processing multiple images in batch mode.

Outputs processed images with bounding boxes around detected faces.

# Results
The face detection project utilizes real-time face detection, providing live detection without storing the results. This means that the detected faces are displayed in real-time, and no image or video files are saved as part of the project.
As the project runs, it captures frames from a video feed or webcam, performs face detection on each frame, and overlays bounding boxes around the detected faces directly on the video feed.
Here is an example of the output:

# Acknowledgments
The face detection model used in this project is based on the OpenCV library and the albumentations.
Special thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable resources and tutorials.
